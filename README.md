#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Ans : Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. Software engineering plays an important role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software application and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication , entertainnment and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Ans: 1 - Development of programming language - this provided the foundation for software engineering . Early programming was done in machine code or assembly language, which was extremely tedious and error-prone

2- The advent of structured programming - this emerged in the late 1960s and became a key milestone in the 1970s as a way to improve the reliability, clarity and maintenability of code.

3- The rise of agile methodologies - agile methodologies emerged in the early 2000s as a response to the limitations of traditional, heavyweight software deelopment processes, such as the waterfall model. traditional methods often struggled to keep up with the fast pace change in technology and business requirements

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

- Requirements : Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
- Design : Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
- Implementation : Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
- Testing : Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
- Deployment : Releasing the software to users or customers
- Maintenance : Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall - sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like waterfall . E.g (requirements, design, implementation.)

Agile - Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change. E.g (Scrum , kanban)

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software developer : Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.

Quality assurance engineer : Ensures software quality by designing and executing tests plans.

project manager : Oversees the planning, execution and deliver of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

- Intergrated Development Environments(IDEs) : software suits tha provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code. (E.g visual studio, Eclipse, Intellij IDEA)

- Version Control Systems(VCS) : Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members(e.g Git, Subversion)

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

- Changing requirements: requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.

- Tight deadlines : pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.

-Technical debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs

Strategies for overcoming challenges- thes include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritiztion of tasks and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

unit testing : Testing individual components or modules of software.

intergration testing : testing interactions between different components or subsystems.

system testing : testing the entire software system as a whole.

acceptance testing : Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

the importance of quality assurance measures such as code reviews, automated testing and continous intergration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. prompt engineering helps avoid getting confusing response by making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt : Tell me about cats?

improved prompt : tell me about the history of domestic cats?

the improved prompt is clear enough so the AI model will know what type of cats i am looking for and in that way it knows exactly how to respond.
